          In 1998, the NUS Climbing Club invited like-minded individuals for a day of climbing in the NUS Bouldering Gym
          and this invitation has reached more and more climbing enthusiasts over the years. As the number of
          participants grew, NUS Climbing Club and TeamNUS Climbing jointly organized a climbing event that goes beyond
          the NUS Bouldering Gym - Boulderactive. Inaugurated in 2001, this event became the first ever national-scale
          climbing-related competition, increasing the profile of bouldering in the public community and triggering
          zealous interest in the sport.<br><br>
          2020 has presented the climbing community with challenges like never before. With new restrictions and
          constant uncertainties, the climbing scene has had to re-adjust itself to scale these limitations.
          Nevertheless, here in Singapore we've seen how bouldering has picked itself up, with gyms striving to serve
          those who share their love for this sport through community-focused initiatives. <br><br>
          With BoulderActive: Reimagined, we too want to ride on the grit and success of our local gyms to not just
          reintroduce, but to reimagine what competition climbing can look like. Starting small, our decentralised
          approach holds the safety of all climbers in mind while offering an experience that isn't any less exciting -
          just different.<br><br>
          Our family here at NUS has dearly missed this large-scale event, and so has the public. We believe
          BoulderActive's comeback will be a meaningful one to many. With a shared desire to bring something fresh, fun
          and unforgettable, it is an honour that this vision can come to life - one that we hope would be a hallmark
          and inspiration for future climbing events.

        Competition climbing, reimagined

        <h2 class="section-heading">WHY REIMAGINED?</h2>
        <p align="justify">
          In recent years, climbing as a sport has seen unprecedented growth, both in Singapore, and across the world.
          It is heartening to see the climbing community flourish and more people growing to love the sport. It remains
          the case, however, that competitions in Singapore remain unexplored by many who may feel inadequately
          prepared, and fears are further magnified with the pandemic across the community. <br />

          This year, Boulderactive seeks to remove these barriers. To do so, we have reimagined what a climbing
          competition looks like - hopefully just for now - while still celebrating the aspects of climbing loved by all
          regardless of their experience. Boulderactive 2021 brings you: <br /><br />

          <b>Flexibility</b><br />
          Our decentralised qualifiers allow climbers to compete at their convenience. With time no longer being a
          constraint, we’re excited to host climbers from all walks of life!<br /><br />

          <b>Freedom</b><br />
          Without the pressure of a timer or other competitors, we hope climbers regardless of experience can feel free
          to push their limits, unfazed and undaunted.<br /><br />

          <b>Community</b><br />
          Behind every success is a team of supporters, and our gym-based competition gives climbers the opportunity to
          climb in a social environment they deem most conducive - whether with friends, or by receiving moral support
          from their friends back home.<br /><br />

          <b>Safety</b><br />
          Last but not least, a good climb is one that takes not only the climber’s success, but also their safety, into
          consideration. With our safe-distancing measures and finals broadcasted post-event, we ensure that neither
          safety nor fun will ever be compromised. Enthusiastic competitors can climb without worrying about their
          health, and avid fans of the sport can cheer their favourites on from the comfort of their home.

          <br /><br />

          We hope that through BA2021, every climber will come out better, wherever they are, whoever they are, whenever
          they climb. So join us! <br><br />
